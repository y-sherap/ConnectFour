### *Description*

Connect Four is a popular game played by kids and adults alike. The rules are simple, yet requires strategy and planning to win the game. 

The basic requirements for this project have been broken into smaller technical tasks, which can be found in this [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/GFrzRcsE/ysherap-project-1) and broadly summarized in the following section.

#### *Project MVP*

*Must Have*
* Ability for 2 players to play the game
* Ability for players to alternate turns
* Ability to easily know:
  * whether and which player has won
  * if the game is a tie
  * the current player
* Ability to restart the game

*Should Have*
* A well designed game
* Animations on texts

*Could Have*
* Ability for a player to compete with the computer
* A score board 

### *Technologies Used*
1. Visual Studio Code to run HTML, CSS, Javascript
2. Trello to manage project requirements 
3. Google Chrome to access the game 

### *Project Overview*
I created this game during the third week of my Software Engineering Immersive course through General Assembly. Prior to enrolling in this program, I had little to no experience with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I wanted to use this project to gain a foundational understanding of functions, loops, and event listeners, all of which have been incorporated into my code. After a week of writing, deleting, staring at the wall, and rewriting my code, I feel more confident in my abilities and am looking forward to building on this knowledge. 

The game comprises:
* A landing page, which includes game instructions, as well as an animated button that directs players to a second html page that houses the Connect Four Board
* A board that consists of 7 empty columns and 6 empty rows with 42 total cells that players can click into in order to fill those spaces with their designated discs
* An animated title
* A dyanmic subheader that displays the following:
  * Current player, *"Player One's Turn"*
  * Winner, *"Player Two Wins!"*
  * If the game is a Draw, *"It's a draw"*

Here's the full walk through of the game:
